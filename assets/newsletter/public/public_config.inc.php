	INSTRUCTIONS:
	You simply need to put the full directory path to your ListMessenger directory
	in this variable called $LM_PATH.

	By default $LM_PATH = "../"; you only need to change this if you move the public
	directory outside of the ListMessenger application directory. Another example
	of a full directory path, may be something like:

	/home/httpd/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/listmessenger/
	- OR -
	d:/websites/domain.com/public_html/listmessenger/

	This is not a URL, do not put the website address to your ListMessenger folder.
*/

// Directory Path (not URL) with trailing slash to your ListMessenger program directory.
	$LM_PATH	= "../";

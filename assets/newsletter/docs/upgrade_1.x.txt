================================================================================

*IMPORTANT:
If you are upgrading from ListMessenger Light 2.x to 2.2, then I have created a
separate upgrade file called upgrade_2.x.txt in this directory to review.

================================================================================

ListMessenger 0.5.0 - ListMessenger Light 1.0.0:

STEP 1)
	Backup your existing listmessenger database. Do not continue unless you
	have a valid backup of your existing listmessenger database. If you do
	continue without a valid backup and something goes wrong your subscriber
	base may be lost.

	You can create a backup of your existing installation by using PHPMyAdmin
	or any other database management tool's Export feature.

STEP 2)
	Now that you have backed up your existing installation's database:

	Login via FTP to your webserver and rename your current listmessenger
	program directory to "listmessenger_backup" or something to that effect.

	In doing this, if something goes wrong during the upgrade, it will be very
	simple for you to revert back to the original version.

	Example, if your current listmessenger installation is running at:
	http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger

	Rename the listmessenger directory to listmessenger_backup, so that
	it exists (non-functioning of course) at:
	http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger_backup

STEP 3)
	Unpack the ListMessenger Light 2.2.1 distribution file with your favourite
	upzip / untar program and rename the extracted directory to "listmessenger"
	or whatever your previous installations directory was named.

STEP 4)
	Modify the contents of ./includes/config.inc.php to reflect the correct
	database and database login information for your MySQL Server. This
	information should be the identical connection information that was in
	your previous versions config.inc.php file.

	If your database connection information is not exactly as specified,
	the upgrade script will not detect you had a previous version and will
	therefore install a clean installation.

	<NOTICE>
	ListMessenger 0.5.0 - ListMessenger Light 1.0.0:
	Do not overwrite this config.inc.php file with the config.inc.php file
	from your previous version, the files have changed and will this cause
	you confusion when you receive errors.
	</NOTICE>

	<TIP>
	If you previously specified a table prefix (in the TABLES_PREFIX
	constant) don't forget to add this to the new version as well.
	</TIP>

STEP 5)
	Upload the entire ListMessenger directory tree (all folders and files)
	to the same directory name as your previous ListMessenger installation
	was under, on a web-server which meets the following requirements:
	-> PHP 5.0.0+ (PHP 5.1.6+ highly recommended)
		\_ pSpell is required for spell checking support.
		\_ ListMessenger uses many of PHP's built in functions which cannot
		   be disabled, such as: file_exists, fopen, fread, fwrite, ini_set
		   ini_get, fsockopen, ob_start, session_start.
	-> MySQL 5+

STEP 6)
	The folling directories, which by default reside within the ListMessenger
	program directory need to be writable by the user that your web-server
	and / or PHP runs as. This can generally be done through your FTP client
	such as Filezilla, Transmit, CuteFTP, and setting the permissions to 777.

	- public/files
	- public/images
	- private/backups
	- private/logs
	- private/tmp

	Unix / Linux Web-Servers:
	Please chmod the those directories to 777 using either your FTP client
	or by command line by entering "chmod 777 directoryname".

	Windows Web-Servers:
	I believe that on most Windows servers directories are already writable
	by the user in which your web-server runs; however, if they are not then
	you should be able to set this information by right clicking on the
	directories and allowing everyone to read / write data to them.

STEP 7)
	Point your web browser to the ListMessenger setup program located in
	the ListMessenger program directory and follow the on-screen instructions
	to upgrade to the current version.

	Example: http://www.yourdomain.com/listmessenger/setup.php

STEP 8)
	After the upgrade has been completed, make sure you delete the
	setup.php file AND setup directory from the ListMessenger directory root.

	After you have verified everything is working correctly with your new
	version you can also delete your old listmessenger_backup directory.

ListMessenger Pro by creating an account in our ListMessenger Members

LISTMESSENGER PRO PLUG)
ListMessenger Light is available for both commercial and non-commercial use, but
it does come with some restrictions. You should not use ListMessenger Light for
mailing lists over 200 subscribers as this can cause your web and mail server
major stresses. ListMessenger Light will continue to function if you go over the
200 subscriber soft-limit; however, you will receive a nag screen stating that
such a situation is not recommended. Please consider upgrading to ListMessenger
Pro which was designed to handle lists of any size.

Upgrading to ListMessenger Pro is easy, no database changes are required and
your list will stay untouched. Simply delete the contents of your ListMessenger
Light directory (minus "includes/config.inc.php") and upload the ListMessenger
Pro files (and your Pro licence key) in their place.

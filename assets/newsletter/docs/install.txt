================================================================================

SHORT VERSION OF INSTRUCTIONS:

1)	Unpack ListMessenger Light 2.2.1 distribution file and upload the contents
	to a directory on your web-server.

2)	Point your web-browser to the directory, and follow the instructions:
	Example: http://www.domain.com/listmessenger

================================================================================

LONGER VERSION OF INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1)
	Unpack ListMessenger Light 2.2.1 with any upzip / untar program. The
	extracted directory will be named "listmessenger-light-2.x.x" or something
	to that effect; it would be a good idea to rename this extracted directory
	to "listmessenger", "mailinglist" or something similar.

STEP 2)
	Upload the entire ListMessenger directory tree (all folders and files)
	to a web-server which meets the following system requirements:
	-> PHP 5.0.0+ (PHP 5.1.6+ highly recommended)
		\_ pSpell is required for spell checking support.
		\_ ListMessenger uses many of PHP's built in functions which cannot
		   be disabled, such as: file_exists, fopen, fread, fwrite, ini_set
		   ini_get, fsockopen, ob_start, session_start.
	-> MySQL 5+

STEP 3)
	The following directories, which by default reside within the ListMessenger
	program directory need to be writable by the user that your web-server
	and / or PHP runs as. This can generally be done through your FTP client
	such as Filezilla, Transmit, CuteFTP, and setting the permissions to 777.

	- public/files
	- public/images
	- private/backups
	- private/logs
	- private/tmp

	Unix / Linux Web-Servers:
	Please chmod the those directories to 777 using either your FTP client
	or by command line by entering "chmod 777 directoryname".

	Windows Web-Servers:
	I believe that on most Windows servers directories are already writable
	by the user in which your web-server runs; however, if they are not then
	you should be able to set this information by right clicking on the
	directories and allowing everyone to read / write data to them.

STEP 4)
	Point your web browser to the ListMessenger setup program located in
	the ListMessenger program directory and follow the on-screen instructions.

	Example: http://www.domain.com/listmessenger/setup.php

STEP 5)
	After the installation has been completed, make sure you delete the
	setup.php file AND setup directory from the ListMessenger directory root.

LISTMESSENGER PRO PLUG)
ListMessenger Light is available for both commercial and non-commercial use, but
it does come with some restrictions. You should not use ListMessenger Light for
mailing lists over 200 subscribers as this can cause your web and mail server
major stress. ListMessenger Light will continue to function if you go over the
200 subscriber soft-limit; however, you will receive a nag screen stating that
such a situation is not recommended. Please consider upgrading to ListMessenger
Pro which was designed to handle lists of any size.

Upgrading to ListMessenger Pro is easy, no database changes are required and
your list will stay untouched. Simply delete the contents of your ListMessenger
Light directory (minus "includes/config.inc.php") and upload the ListMessenger
Pro files (and your Pro licence key) in their place.
